        The theme that I am exploring is “colour” because I want to explore the
        effect and mood colours convey. The colour within the photos can be
        overlooked and it is not always understood, the importance of colour and
        the effect of the mood it has on the images.
      </p>
      <p>
        My aim for my personal investigation is to explore the effect of colours
        and to look deeper into colour theory to see how the mood of the photo
        differs. My strengths are photographing city-scape during the night,
        capturing the city streets and lights. Another strength would be is
        photo manipulation, changing the image to create something that
        otherwise that cannot be seen in reality. I am playing to my strengths
        in this project using photo manipulation techniques and focusing on the
        city.

        Some areas I would like to improve is composition techniques I want to
        be able to use techniques such as framing or rule of thirds to make my
        images more appealing to look at. To develop this I can take time out to
        take photos purely using composition to work on this skill.

        One artist that inspires me is Troy Paiva and his use of colour is the
        dominant feature in his work. He focuses on old abandoned objects and
        gives them life and a character. This leads into another one of his
        techniques I like called contrasting as in the photo, the subject is
        often abandoned buildings or rusty cars. Contrasting is a technique I
        will be mainly using throughout this project as it helps create an
        atmosphere which is my main goal for the assignment. My starting point
        it to further research photographer Troy Paiva and look at what other
        techniques he uses and try to implement them into my own work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will manage my time by creating weekly goals where I will complete a
        section of my project by the end of every week.
      </p>
      <p>
        To conclude my goal for this project is to look into colours and explore
        the effects they have on the mood of the photo, I will look at
        photographers that like Troy Paiva that use colour in their work to
        create an atmosphere. I want to practice my composition in order to make
        my photos more appealing for my final piece which will implement
        multiple ideas from multiple photographers.
