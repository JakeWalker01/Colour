  <p>
    Although my last photo shoot didn't go to plan I believe this photo is an
    exception. It captures multiple elements of composition such as reflections
    in the water which makes the photo look more balanced and overall more
    pleasing to look at. Other techniques include symmetry which again make the
    photo more balanced. The photo was taken at around 8 AM to capture the sun
    rising and I managed to gain hints of pink and yellow in my photo which
    portray a sense of calmness.I wanted these colours to be highlighted more so
    I used photoshop to edit the hue and saturation the make the pink more
    vibrant. I then used a brush tool and set the blend mode to soft light to
    paint artificial light onto the side of the building to allow more colour to
    be spread within the photo. Overall this photo works well but if I was to
    redo it I would be more patient and invest more time into capturing the sky
    when it's portraying a perfect yellow and pink gradient.
