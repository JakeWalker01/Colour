    <p>
      Troy Paiva has been a light photographer since 1989. In Troy’s
      photographs, we see that he likes to isolate himself in the middle of
      nowhere or with abandoned buildings or objects to create a sense of
      loneliness. A quote from Pavia “I love the surreal feeling of wandering
      through abandoned subdivisions... Your senses are heightened and you feel
      the weight of time.” shows there is a contrast between the lonely world
      and his enthusiasm for it which can be shown through his photography. In
      the image of the broken car, for example, we see a warm glow towards the
      back of the car which contrasts with the cold blue of the sky. We also see
      a pale red glow that represents love which contrasts with the lonely
      atmosphere. This type of style can be seen in numerous pieces of work such
      as the abandoned staircase. We can see rubble scattered everywhere on the
      floor and a brittle old staircase. There is wearing on the rocks and the
      is a cold blue atmosphere. But Troy has cleverly used this red glow to
      counteract this negative pale blueness and the red glow gives the place a
      bit of life and fills that emptiness.
