    <p>
      I chose this for my final piece as I took inspiration from two different
      photographers, Liam wong and Mathew Guido. I used a soft lighting
      technique inspired by Guido and the use of sunglasses to add reflection
      composition to the piece as well and then the neon colours Wong uses to
      create the atmosphere. I used a (lens) to allow the background lights to
      be blurred which makes the attention be drawn to the subject but also
      makes the light less harsh overall giving this peaceful effect. I chose
      blue and pink lights as they compliment each other well on the colour
      wheel but also because blue gives a sense of trust and the bright pink
      shows a sense of passion and love.

    <p>
      Overall I am pleased with the outcome of this as the two colours bounce
      off the subject perfectly.
