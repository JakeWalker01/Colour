      <h1>LIAM WONG</h1>
      <p>
        Liam Wong is a Scottish born photographer who focuses his work in
        southern east countries including Korea and Japan. Some of his most
        famous work is from Japan, specifically Tokyo in the city streets at
        night. Wong uses a Canon 5D IV and his aim is to capture the neon
        colours of the city whilst using composition techniques including
        framing and symmetry to make the image more appealing. He uses a low
        aperture to give the photo more depth and so the focus is less on the
        physical objects and more about the colours which create emotions around
        the image.

        His photos use soft light and there are rarely any shadows within the
        image. This allows the colour to be highlighted throughout the whole
        image again making it the focus. He also reflects light in windows and
        water to allow the colour to spread out in the image more. He often
        finds patterns to capturing in the streets of Tokyo such as repeating
        lights or designs on buildings to make the image more simplistic which
        compliments the photo to make it more engaging with the viewer.

        Another technique he includes is called framing and he does this by
        capturing narrow streets allowing the buildings to frame the path that
        leads into the horizon. This not only creates a sense of depth but also
        allows the focus to once again be drawn to the bright colourful neon
        signs that follow the road onwards. All these techniques allow the focus
        to be set on the vivid colours which portray emotions corresponding to
        the colour, for example, intense neon blues convey a sense of
        tranquility and calmness. These colours can be captured naturally or
        digitally manipulated in Lightroom or Photoshop. Liam Wong uses
        lightroom to control the amount of hue and saturation that goes into the
        photo. Although Wongâ€™s work is edited a great deal he says he tries to
        focus more on composition and photography techniques otherwise the
        editing would be pointless.

        On the other hand without editing, his work could be quite plain and
        simple and the post editing as he can intensify the colours to allow for
        more emotion to be emitted. What I like about Liam Wongs photography is
        the colours used, the bright, neon blues and pinks complementing the
        city theme. The contrast of the dark eerie streets with the bright neon
        lights is fascinating to me on how colour can change the atmosphere so
        drastically. Liam is going to be a big inspiration and I am going to try
        to include my the colours and the way he contrasts the photos in my own
        work using photoshop and lightroom techniques as well.
