      I felt for this shoot this image had the most potential as a winding
      street would emphasize the theme of movement that I wanted to gain from
      this photo. I then using a photoshop preset, set the background tonight
      and replaced the sky using a dark blue brush tool. Then I used the pen
      tool to draw out my streaks and filled it in with a solid white. Then by
      piling multiple layers of the same color that are slightly wider each time
      with different opacities, it created this glowing effect to look more
      realistic and like a light painting. I decided to use 3 colours, blue and
      pink for the style of Liam wong creating a calm atmosphere. Then another
      piece making the lines red to further emphasize this mood of movement and
      the red symbolizes speed. This photo went well but if I was to redo it I
      would try to focus on elements of composition like framing or rule of
      thirds.
