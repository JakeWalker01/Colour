      I chose to manipulate this photo as it had the most composition out of all
      of them. Using photoshop I extended the length of the tunnel by copy and
      pasting the original image onto itself then scaling it down and blending
      it with the background using a layer mask. I did this so the photo would
      have more depth to it and the leading lines have more impact. I then used
      brush and experimented with different blend modes including soft light and
      overlay create the lighting the style of liam wong. I chose to paint in
      blue and pink as they are analogous colours and compliment each other well
      creating this relaxed atmosphere which was inspired by Liam wong. Without
      the colour the photo would look bland and uninteresting and the reflection
      of the colour make the image pop.
