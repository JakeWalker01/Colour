    <p>
      My intentions for this shoot is to capture dark and uninteresting things
      to edit them in the style of Liam Wong and Troy Paiva. I want to also make
      the image more appealing. I will shoot at night so the colours will
      contrast more with a darker background and stand out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Overall, I didn’t like the outcome of the shoot, many pictures were under
      exposed and didn’t contain much composition. If I were to do this again I
      would plan my route and make sure I’m capturing interesting photos using a
      range of composition. To make sure the images weren’t underexposed I would
      use a higher ISO so more light is let in. If the images were grainy I
      would sharpen them in photoshop.
